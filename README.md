# ***Reinforcement Learning***

- ***Feedback-based machine learning approach.***
- ***An `agent` interacts with an `environment` with an objective to `maximize` its total `reward`.***
 
***The agent takes an action based on the environment state and the environment returns the reward and the next state. The agent learns from trial and error, initially taking random actions and over time identifying the actions that lead to long-term rewards.***

- ***`Agent`: Learns and makes decisions.***
- ***`Environment`: The external system the agent interacts with.***
- ***`Action`: What the agent does.***
- ***`State`: The current situation of the agent.***
- ***`Reward`: Feedback from the environment.***
  
### ***`Feedback`***:
- ***Correct actions receive positive feedback.***
- ***Incorrect actions receive negative feedback or penalties.***

### ***We can break down reinforcement learning into five simple steps:***   
- ***The agent is at state zero in an environment.***
- ***It will take an action based on a specific strategy.***
- ***It will receive a reward or punishment based on that action.***
- ***By learning from previous moves and optimizing the strategy.*** 
- ***The process will repeat until an optimal strategy is found.***
